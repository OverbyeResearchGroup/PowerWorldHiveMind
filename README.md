<p align="center"><strong>Your agent on PowerWorldHiveMind.</strong></p>

### Tired of babysitting your coding agent?

Tired of explaining, again, that `SaveCase` silently does nothing and that a filtered
write changes nothing at all?

**PowerWorldHiveMind juices up your agent.** Drop it in, and your assistant stops
guessing at PowerWorld and starts knowing it, including the failures that never raise an
exception and quietly hand you a wrong answer.

You give it a case, it gives you the analysis, and you stop having to be the documentation.

**Does it work? We measured it: 19 of 23 against 6 for the same assistant with a web
browser, marked blind.** [See the benchmark](BENCHMARK.md).

### It runs the whole study

Most tooling answers "which branches are overloaded" and stops. The useful work comes
after that readout:

| Instead of | You get |
|---|---|
| "12 N-1 violations" | *"All 12 come from one corridor — the four parallel 69 kV circuits between bus 19 and 23. Losing any one overloads the other three."* |
| "here are the loadings" | *"Build 19→23 and violations go 12 → 2. Do **not** build 27→29 — I tested it, and it makes N-1 worse."* |
| "the 2024 case has more branches" | *"The plan adds 691 branches and 199 generators, retires nothing, and none of it is a renumbering artifact — I checked."* |
| "the case has renewables" | *"9 of 45 units carry PFW models, so this case can run a weather study. Here is the hourly output."* |

It diagnoses, proposes a fix, applies it, re-verifies, and tells you which options to
reject. In [the remediation demo](demos/violation-remediation.md), two of five plausible
reinforcements made the system worse, including the one an engineer would pick first.
You only find that out by measuring it.

This repository is a knowledge base: 87 linked markdown files about driving PowerWorld
Simulator from Python. The kit itself is markdown, with nothing to build or run. It needs
two Python packages, which your agent installs. Point your assistant at it and it starts
writing PowerWorld code that works instead of code that looks plausible.

It writes back, too. Say *"write that up as a page"* and your agent files what you
worked out into your own copy, in the same shape as every page here. Your clone does
not sync back to this repository, so what you add stays yours. See
[Add to it](#add-to-it).

Hand it a case file and ask a question in plain English:

> *"Here's my case at `C:\cases\mysystem.pwb`. Which branches are most heavily loaded?"*
>
> *"Add a 138 kV line between bus 12 and bus 40 and tell me what it does to the
> N-1 violations."*

## Install

Paste this into Claude Code. It is a sentence, not a command:

```
Install the PowerWorld knowledge base: git clone https://github.com/ChunSikPark/PowerWorldHiveMind ~/.claude/skills/powerworld-hivemind
```

Then load it:

```
/reload-plugins
```

That is the whole installation. Anything under `~/.claude/skills/` carrying a
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` loads automatically, so there is no marketplace to add, no
`/plugin` command, and no terminal. It works in the desktop app and the CLI alike.

**Reopening the app is not the same as loading it.** Reopening usually restores the same
conversation, and a restored conversation keeps whatever it started with. Use
`/reload-plugins`, or start a new conversation.

Then run `/powerworld-hivemind:powerworld-setup`. That installs the Python packages and
checks whether this machine can drive PowerWorld at all, including the separately licensed
SimAuto add-on that catches most people.

To update it, ask Claude to `git pull` in that folder. To remove it, delete the folder.

**Codex** reads the portable plugin manifest this repo also ships:

```
codex plugin marketplace add ChunSikPark/PowerWorldHiveMind
```

Then open `/plugins`, install **powerworld-hivemind**, and start a new session. *(Not yet
tested against a released Codex build — if it fails, clone it by hand and open an issue.)*

**Any other agent** — Cursor, Windsurf, anything that reads your files: clone the repo and
start your agent inside the folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ChunSikPark/PowerWorldHiveMind
cd PowerWorldHiveMind
pip install esapp TeamOverbyeWeather
```

Then tell it: `Read AGENTS.md and run the preflight.`

### Never done this before?

The install above assumes Claude Code is already working. From a standing start it is six
steps, about fifteen minutes:

1. **Install Claude** — [claude.com/download](https://claude.com/download). Needs a paid
   plan and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win).
2. **Install Python** — [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/), and
   tick **"Add Python to PATH"** on the first screen. Missing that box is the most common
   way this goes wrong.
3. **Click `Code`** in Claude, top left. `Chat and Cowork` cannot see your files.
4. **Paste the install line above**, then `/reload-plugins`.
5. **Run `/powerworld-hivemind:powerworld-setup`** — it installs the Python packages and
   checks whether this machine can drive PowerWorld at all.
6. **Prove it worked** — in a folder unrelated to PowerWorld, ask what
   `pw.esa.SaveCase("out.pwb")` does. "Silently writes no file" means it worked. "Saves the
   case" means the knowledge did not load.

**[GETTING-STARTED.md](GETTING-STARTED.md)** is the same six steps with screenshots, what
each failure looks like, and what to do about it. Written for someone who has never
installed Python or used an AI coding agent.

### Which file your agent actually reads

This depends on which route you took, and the two are not the same.

**On the plugin route**, a plugin ships skills and commands, not instruction files. Claude
Code loads `skills/powerworld/SKILL.md` and `skills/knowledge-base-page/SKILL.md`, and
registers `/powerworld-hivemind:powerworld-setup` and `/powerworld-hivemind:kb-page`. It
does **not** load `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md` from the plugin. `SKILL.md` carries the rules that matter
and points at the pages; the routing table in `AGENTS.md` stays on disk for the agent to
open when it needs it.

**On the manual route**, the instructions live in `AGENTS.md`, and the kit ships a shim for
the tools that load a different filename. There is nothing for you to configure.

| Your agent | Loads | Shipped as |
|---|---|---|
| Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf | `AGENTS.md` | the file itself |
| Claude Code | `CLAUDE.md` | a one-line `@AGENTS.md` import |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | a generated copy of `AGENTS.md` |

Verified against each vendor's own documentation on 2026-09-09 — read off the docs, not
smoke-tested on an installed client. `GEMINI.md` is generated: edit `AGENTS.md` instead,
or your change is overwritten.

Using something not on the list? Find out which filename it loads at startup. If it is
not one of the three above, point it at `AGENTS.md` yourself — and please open an issue,
so the next person does not have to work it out twice.

**Into an existing project:** copy the cloned `PowerWorldHiveMind` folder in as a
subdirectory. The kit is plain markdown — nothing to build, nothing to run.

## See it work

Worked runs on a real 37-bus case — **real output, including the failures**:

| Demo | What it shows |
|---|---|
| [**Comparing planning cases**](demos/comparing-planning-cases.md) | **Multi-case.** Diff a 2016 vs 2024 case: 691 new branches, 199 new generators, then a contingency set for only the new devices — and the trap that makes the naive answer 87% wrong |
| [**Violation remediation**](demos/violation-remediation.md) | **The full study.** Diagnose 12 N-1 violations down to one cause, test five reinforcements, rank them — and find that two make things worse |
| [Adding a device](demos/adding-a-device.md) | Three attempts that reported success and created nothing, then the fix. The silent-failure problem in full |
| [Power flow & sensitivities](demos/power-flow-and-sensitivities.md) | AC, DC, LODF, PTDF — with the `1e8` sentinel and an error whose obvious fix fails the same way |
| [Contingency & aux](demos/contingency-and-aux.md) | N-1 from scratch, then auto-generating a filter + contingency `.aux` |
| [Weather to megawatts](demos/timestep-and-pfw.md) | PFW models, TimeStep, and why "zero output" is usually a setup bug |
| [Handling errors](methods/handling-errors.md) | How the agent recovers on its own, and the three cases where it should stop and ask you |

Just say what you want — [the full prompt list](demos/start-here.md):

> *"Which branches are most heavily loaded?"*
> *"Add a line between bus 27 and bus 31 and tell me if it helps N-1."*
> *"Run N-1 on everything."*
> *"Build me a contingency file for the five most loaded lines."*
> *"Run N-1, work out what's wrong, and tell me what to build to fix it."*
> *"Compare my 2016 and 2024 cases and tell me what the plan builds."*

## Does it actually help?

**[BENCHMARK.md](BENCHMARK.md)** — the same AI model answered the same 23 PowerWorld questions
two ways: with PowerWorldHiveMind on disk, and as a capable assistant told nothing about
PowerWorld but free to search the open web. Every answer was then marked right or wrong by a
grader that did not know which setup wrote it.

![Where PowerWorldHiveMind helps and where it does not](assets/headline.svg)

**On the things PowerWorld gets wrong quietly, it is not close.** 16 questions where
Simulator accepts your call, reports success and returns something wrong: HiveMind solved
**15**. A fresh assistant with the whole open web solved 4. The web can tell you what a
command does. It cannot tell you which commands lie about having done it.

**On looking up a command name, open PowerWorld's manual instead.** HiveMind managed
4 of 7 there and spent more searches doing it than the web did. This
repository deliberately does not publish argument syntax, so it will sometimes name the right
command and still not give you a signature to call it with.

Overall: **19 of 23 against 6 of 23**. The page lists every question, both verdicts, what
each setup spent, and how an earlier version of this benchmark was scored wrong.

## About PowerWorld itself

The PowerWorld half of this kit needs three things, and the third one catches people
out:

| Requirement | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Windows** | PowerWorld automation uses a Windows-only interface. No Mac or Linux version exists |
| **PowerWorld Simulator, installed and licensed** | This kit drives Simulator; it does not replace it |
| **The SimAuto add-on, licensed** | **Licensed separately from Simulator.** Your Simulator can work perfectly while automation is unavailable, and the program gives you no hint |

Without a PowerWorld licence, most of this kit is not usable — it is about operating
Simulator. The exception is fetching and inspecting weather data, which is pure Python:
see [methods/teamoverbyeweather-client.md](methods/teamoverbyeweather-client.md). But
*applying* that weather requires PowerWorld, since TimeStep runs inside Simulator.

### Talking to PowerWorld in files instead of function calls

There is a second way to work. It changes the shape of the conversation rather than the
speed of it.

Turn on one setting and Simulator starts watching a folder. Drop a `.aux` script into that
folder and it runs it, then writes the log back out as a text file. Write a file, read a
file. Nothing of yours talks to PowerWorld.

That draws a boundary around PowerWorld, not around code. Your agent still writes and runs
plenty of it: checking the script before it drops it, watching for the run to finish, and
reading the result CSVs, because the log is prose and the answers are in the CSVs. Code on
your side, files across the boundary.

Your agent can work this way. It writes the script, you drop it in, and the results come
back as CSV files you both read. You see every script before it runs, everything either side
produces is a file you can read, diff and archive, and you end up with a script you own and
can re-run rather than a transcript of an API session that happened once.

[methods/aux-file-mode.md](methods/aux-file-mode.md) has the setup steps, the rules, and a
working template that opens a bus and measures what that did to the system.

It is the slower path, and it costs you two things. It is not headless: a dialog has to stay
open, so it will not batch or run in parallel. And a script that fails the wrong way is never
cleaned up, so Simulator re-runs it every poll interval until you delete the file yourself.
Both are on the page, along with the three commands that will silently ruin a run.

Recent builds only; see
[concepts/version-requirements.md](concepts/version-requirements.md).

### What it does not cover

Contingency analysis fundamentals, OPF formulation, PV/QV curve studies, and transient
stability theory. Nor weather science — dynamic line ratings, IEEE 738 thermal
modelling, and extreme-event selection are deliberately out of scope.

This kit is about **operating PowerWorld**. It will tell you which script action runs a
PV study; it will not teach you what a PV curve means.

---

## Why this exists

Most PowerWorld automation problems are not hard, they are *quiet*. A write to a
filtered subset does nothing and reports success. The COM `SaveCase` silently no-ops. A
DC solve reports zero mismatch even when the generation schedule is short by a gigawatt.
Contingency results persist stale inside the case file, so a fresh read can be from last
week's run.

None of that is in the vendor documentation, and an AI assistant working from general
knowledge will confidently walk into every one of them. These pages are the accumulated
list of what actually goes wrong, written so an assistant reads the warning at the exact
moment it is about to make the mistake.

---

## Add to it

The kit is a knowledge base you are meant to **grow**, not just read. Anything you
work out in a session and leave in the chat is gone when the session ends.

**Just say so in plain English.** The agent loads the page-writing skill on its own:

> *write that up as a page*
> *save what we just worked out*
> *add a page about how the filter expression language handles nested groups*
> *document this gotcha before I forget it*

**Or call it directly:**

```
/powerworld-hivemind:kb-page
```

The `powerworld-hivemind:` prefix is part of the name, same as the setup command.

**Not using the plugin?** Tell your agent to read
[skills/knowledge-base-page/SKILL.md](skills/knowledge-base-page/SKILL.md). It is
one self-contained markdown file with no dependencies — nothing to install and no
script to run.

### What it will do

1. **Search first.** If a page already covers the topic it edits that page rather
   than adding a second one. Two pages on one subject is the failure this base
   exists to avoid.
2. **File it** in `concepts/` (what a thing is), `methods/` (how to do a thing),
   `references/` (a code or API surface) or `demos/` (a worked run).
3. **Write the house shape** — frontmatter, then `## Abstract`, `## Connections`,
   `## Content`, with relative markdown links to related pages.
4. **Add the `index.md` row**, so the page is findable. A page nobody can find is a
   page nobody reads.

Ask it to *check the base* instead and it runs two one-line checks — which pages
have no `index.md` row, and which links point at a file that does not exist.

Your copy is yours. A clone does not sync back here, so pages you add stay in your
repo and nothing you write is published anywhere. If you do want a page upstream,
open a pull request.

## See it as a graph

Open the repository folder as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) — *Open folder
as vault*, then **Ctrl/Cmd+G** — to see the 47 pages and the links between them.
Nothing to install or convert. The repo ships `.obsidian/graph.json`, so the graph
arrives coloured by folder with `index.md` filtered out, since it links to every page
and would swamp the view.
