# Method: Getting weather data with the TeamOverbyeWeather client

## Abstract

`TeamOverbyeWeather` is a pip-installable Python client for the Team Overbye weather
portal. One call downloads a weather dataset, crops it to a region, and crops it to a
time window, returning `.pww` files ready for PowerWorld. This is the kit's front door
for getting the `.pww` files PowerWorld's TimeStep feature consumes, and the **one part
that needs no PowerWorld licence** — the client, the PWW reader, and the cropping tools
are pure Python. Verified against version 0.4.0.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [pww-data](../concepts/pww-data.md) · [timestep-workflow](../concepts/timestep-workflow.md)
- **Next:** [timestep-simulation-setup](timestep-simulation-setup.md) to feed the downloaded PWW into PowerWorld

## Content

### Install

```bash
pip install TeamOverbyeWeather
```

Depends only on `numpy`, `requests`, and `tqdm`. No PowerWorld, no Windows requirement.

### The whole thing in five lines

```python
from TeamOverbyeWeather import WeatherClient

client = WeatherClient()
files = client.download("era5", "2021-02", region="TX", dest="./weather")
print(files)   # [PosixPath('weather/era5_texas_2021-02.pww')]
```

`download()` fetches, crops to the region, and crops to the time window server- or
client-side as appropriate, then writes `.pww`. Everything else on this page is detail.

### What data is available

Do not guess source or type names — ask the server:

```python
client.sources()          # ['era5', 'extreme', 'hrrr', 'noaa']
client.types("era5")      # ['historical', 'na', 'north_america', 'texas', 'tx']
client.types("hrrr")      # ['archive', 'current', 'forecast', 'history',
                          #  'hourly_archive', 'hourly_current']
client.types("noaa")      # ['archive', 'forecast', 'recent']
client.types("extreme")   # ['events']
client.catalog()          # everything, as a dict
client.status()           # server health
```

The four sources, and when to reach for each:

| Source | What it is | Use it for |
|---|---|---|
| `era5` | ECMWF reanalysis, hourly, ~0.25° | Long historical records. The default for screening a whole year |
| `hrrr` | NOAA High-Resolution Rapid Refresh, ~3 km, sub-hourly | Refining a specific event once screening has found it |
| `noaa` | NOAA GFS forecasts and archive | Forward-looking studies |
| `extreme` | The portal's curated extreme-event catalogue | Jumping straight to a known event without hunting for its dates |

Screen wide with `era5`, then refine a specific window with `hrrr`. Downloading HRRR for
a full year is neither necessary nor kind to the server.

### Selecting a region

Four mutually exclusive ways, in increasing order of precision:

```python
client.download("era5", "2021-02", region="TX")                       # a state
client.download("era5", "2021-02", iso="<ISO>")                        # an ISO footprint
client.download("era5", "2021-02", bbox=(25.8, -106.7, 36.5, -93.5))  # lat/lon box
client.download("era5", "2021-02")                                    # everything, usually too much
```

Discover valid identifiers rather than guessing:

```python
client.regions()                    # every layer the server knows
client.region_ids("states")         # ['AL', 'AK', 'AZ', 'AR', 'CA', ...]
```

`bbox` is `(lat_min, lon_min, lat_max, lon_max)`. West longitudes are negative.

**A too-large request raises `RegionTooLargeError` rather than silently truncating.**
That is the server protecting itself; narrow the region or shorten the window.

### Selecting a time window

`dates` accepts a single date, a month string, or a list. For sub-day precision, add
`time_start` and `time_end`:

```python
files = client.download(
    "era5",
    "2021-02",
    region="TX",
    time_start="2021-02-14T00:00:00Z",
    time_end="2021-02-19T23:00:00Z",
    dest="./winter_storm_uri",
)
```

### The full signature

```python
client.download(
    source,                # 'era5' | 'hrrr' | 'noaa' | 'extreme'
    dates,                 # date, month string, or list
    type=None,             # from client.types(source)
    region=None,           # state/region id
    iso=None,              # ISO footprint
    bbox=None,             # (lat_min, lon_min, lat_max, lon_max)
    time_start=None,
    time_end=None,
    dest=".",              # output directory
    show_progress=None,    # overrides the client-level setting
    local_crop=True,       # crop client-side after download
    keep_raw=False,        # keep the uncropped download too
) -> list[Path]
```

Two flags:

- `local_crop=True` (the default) crops on your machine after downloading. Set it
  `False` only if you want exactly what the server sent.
- `keep_raw=True` keeps the uncropped file alongside the cropped one. Useful when you
  expect to re-crop the same download several ways; wasteful otherwise.

### Errors it raises

| Exception | Meaning | What to do |
|---|---|---|
| `RegionTooLargeError` | The requested region × time window exceeds the server's limit | Narrow the region, or split the time window and concatenate |
| `ServerBusyError` | The portal is under load | Back off and retry. Do not hammer it in a loop |
| `WeatherAPIError` | Anything else from the API | Read the message; usually a bad source/type/region name. Call `client.sources()` and `client.types()` to check |

```python
from TeamOverbyeWeather import RegionTooLargeError, ServerBusyError, WeatherAPIError
```

### Working with PWW files locally, without PowerWorld

The package reads and writes the PWW format directly. This is how you inspect weather
data on a machine with no PowerWorld licence.

```python
from TeamOverbyeWeather import pww_io

header, stations, arr = pww_io.read_pww_file("weather/era5_texas_2021-02.pww")
print(header)              # metadata: fields, time base, counts
print(len(stations))       # weather stations in the file
print(arr.shape)           # (time, station, field) numpy array
```

Crop, concatenate, and write back:

```python
from TeamOverbyeWeather import pww_io, localcrop

# crop an existing file on disk in one call
localcrop.crop_file("big.pww", "texas_only.pww",
                    bbox=(25.8, -106.7, 36.5, -93.5))

# or work in memory
header, stations, arr = pww_io.crop_to_bbox(header, stations, arr,
                                            (25.8, -106.7, 36.5, -93.5))
header, arr = pww_io.crop_to_timerange(header, arr, t_start, t_end)

# stitch several downloads into one continuous series
header, stations, arr = pww_io.concat_time([piece1, piece2, piece3])

open("combined.pww", "wb").write(pww_io.write_pww(header, stations, arr))
```

`concat_time` is the client-side answer to a region-too-large or window-too-long
rejection: download the pieces separately, then join them.

### Handing the result to PowerWorld

The `.pww` file this produces is the input to PowerWorld's TimeStep simulation. Continue
at [timestep-simulation-setup](timestep-simulation-setup.md), which loads it with `TimeStepLoadPWWRangeLatLon` and
runs the weather-to-MW conversion.

Crop before loading, not after. PowerWorld will happily ingest a continental PWW and
then spend a long time on stations you do not care about.

### What this client is not

It serves the Team Overbye portal specifically. It is not a general ERA5 or HRRR client
— for raw upstream access, see weather sources. Its value is that the region crop,
the time crop, and the PWW conversion are already done, which is normally the tedious
part.
