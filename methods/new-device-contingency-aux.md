# Building a Contingency Set for Chosen Devices, and an AUX That Carries It

## Abstract

How to turn **a list of devices** (e.g. the branches and generators that are new in a
planning case) into a PowerWorld contingency set, restrict violation reporting to **the
areas you care about**, and ship both as one `.aux` file that loads into the case — without
ever saving the case. The mechanism is **autoinsert-then-restrict**: run the case's own
`CTGAutoInsert`, match your devices to the labels it produced, and write only those out.
Hand-writing `Contingency` records from scratch invents labels PowerWorld would not use.

Five things here are silent failures, all live-measured on
`Synth2k_case` on 2026-08-17 — each produces a plausible wrong
answer, not an error:

> **`ElementType`, `DeleteExisting` and `Handle3WXF` are *concise* names.** PowerWorld's
> object-field export lists two names per field, and these three appear only in the Concise
> Variable Name column. Grep the export for them and you find nothing, which reads as "the
> field does not exist". Their full variable names are `CtgAutoInsElementType`,
> `CtgAutoInsDeleteExistCtgs` and `Include3WXfifFoundWithXf`. Both spellings are accepted;
> search the export on either column before concluding a field is missing.

1. **`CTG_AutoInsert_Options` rejects `ElementType=GEN` without complaining** and leaves it
   at `BRANCH`. You ask for 743 generator outages and get 3,911 branch ones.
2. **The `CTGElement` SUBDATA action string must be quoted.** Unquoted, PowerWorld parses
   the *first* contingency and drops the other 690 with no error.
3. **`LoadAux` needs an ABSOLUTE path** — a relative one resolves against `pwrworld.exe`'s
   working directory, not yours.
4. **`LoadAux` merges, it does not replace.** Loading a 220-contingency list into a case
   that already has a set gives you both.
5. **`Ctg_Options.CTG_ReportMonitoredAreas` is a decoy** — it only affects text-file report
   writing. The real area switch is `Area.BGReportLimits`.

## Connections

- **Up:** [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md) · esapp package
- **Input from:** identify differences — produces the device list this method turns into a contingency set
- **Across:** [reading-violationctg](reading-violationctg.md) (what you read back after solving this set) ·
  [powerworld-limitset-setdata](powerworld-limitset-setdata.md) (the limit *thresholds*; this page is the limit *scope*) ·
  [save-powerworld-case](save-powerworld-case.md) · [adding-devices-esapp](adding-devices-esapp.md) · [parallel-contingency-solve](../concepts/parallel-contingency-solve.md)
- **Deeper:** aux script catalog for the full SCRIPT action list; the working
  implementation is `Power_System/regional-contingency/main.py`, which consumes the
  `new_devices_for_contingencies*.xlsx` produced by `identify_differences`.

## Content

### Step 1 — build the full N-1 set in memory, then keep only what you want

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("EnterMode(EDIT);")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("Delete(Contingency);")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(
    "SetData(CTG_AutoInsert_Options, "
    "[ElementType, DeleteExisting, Handle3WXF], [BRANCH, YES, INSERT3WXF]);")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("CTGAutoInsert;")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("EnterMode(RUN);")
```

`ElementType` is `BRANCH` or **`GENERATOR`** — **never `GEN`**. `GEN` is accepted by the
parser, silently ignored, and leaves the previous value in place:

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("SetData(CTG_AutoInsert_Options,[ElementType],[GEN]);")
pw.esa.GetParametersSingleElement("CTG_AutoInsert_Options", ["ElementType"], [""])
# -> 'BRANCH'          <- the write did not happen, and nothing said so
# 'GENERATOR' and 'Gen' both -> 'GENERATOR'
```

**Always read the option back and assert it** before `CTGAutoInsert`. `Handle3WXF` applies
to branches only. On case 3 this yields **3,911 branch** contingencies (= its branch count)
and **743 generator** ones (= its generator count).

### Step 2 — match your devices to the labels autoinsert chose

Read `ContingencyElement` with an explicit field list
(`CTGLabel, BusNum, BusNum:1, ElementID, Object, Action`):

| device | `Object` | `BusNum` / `BusNum:1` | `ElementID` | example `CTGLabel` |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| branch | `BRANCH 1001 1064 1` | both ends | **the circuit ID** | `L_001001ODESSA20-001064ODESSA30C1` |
| 3W xfmr | `BRANCH …` | both ends | circuit | `T_…` prefix |
| generator | `GEN 1004 1` | bus / **`0`** | **the `GenID`** | `G_001004ODONNELL11U1` |

Two matching rules that are easy to get wrong, both inherited from [reading-violationctg](reading-violationctg.md):

- **`ContingencyElement` has no `LineCircuit`.** The circuit ID is `ElementID` (verified on
  a 3-circuit bank: `'1'`, `'10'`, `'20'`). For generators `ElementID` is the `GenID`.
- **Match the bus pair UNORDERED and never parse the `CTGLabel`.** A case may store a branch
  either way round, and the label embeds *truncated* substation names, which collide.

### Step 3 — write the AUX, in PowerWorld's own shape

Get the ground truth from PowerWorld rather than guessing — it will export the set it is
holding:

```python
# Write ONLY through RunScriptCommand -- the COM SaveCase method silently no-ops,
# see methods/save-powerworld-case.md. This applies to every PowerWorld file write, not
# cases: SaveData through RunScriptCommand produced a real 523 KB file here.
# NOTE: SaveContingencies is NOT a script command ("Unknown script command").
# The filter argument is a bare string; the sort lists MUST be bracketed.
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(
    f'SaveData("{abs_path}",AUX,Contingency,[CTGLabel,CTGSkip],[CTGElement],"",[],[],YES);')
```

which writes (3,911 contingencies → 523 KB):

```
Contingency (Name,Skip)
{
"L_001001ODESSA20-001064ODESSA30C1" "NO "
   <SUBDATA CTGElement>
     "BRANCH 1001 1064 1 OPEN" "" CHECK 0 NO
   </SUBDATA>
}
```

Copy that shape when writing a **subset** by hand in Python. `Contingency (CTGLabel,CTGSkip)`
works as the header too. **The action string must be quoted**: written as bare
`BRANCH 1001 1064 1 OPEN`, a 691-contingency file loads as **one** contingency and the load
reports success.

### Step 4 — scope the violations to your areas, in the same file

`Area.BGReportLimits` — *"Set to NO to not monitor elements (buses, branches or
interfaces)"* — is PowerWorld's own limit-monitoring switch (the `Zone` object carries it
too). Write every area, not just yours, or you inherit whatever the case already restricted:

```
Area (AreaNum,BGReportLimits)
{
"1" "NO"
"5" "YES"
}
```

Measured on case 3 (8 areas, 2,000 buses, 3,911 branches), reading the **effective** flags
`Bus.BusMonEle:1` / `Branch.LineMonEle:1` — not the requested ones:

| monitored areas | buses monitored | branches monitored |
|---|---|---|
| all 8, as shipped | 2000 | 3878 |
| `5` (North Central) | 483 = area 5 exactly | 866 = its own 822 **+ 44 ties** |
| `3, 5` | 630 | 1341 |

**A bus is monitored when its area is; a branch when EITHER end is** — so tie lines into the
region are included automatically, which is the opposite of the `ViolationCTG.AreaNum` trap
in [reading-violationctg](reading-violationctg.md), where a naive filter *drops* them. Related knobs found in the
same field-list dig: `Area.BGReportLimMinKV` / `BGReportLimMaxKV` (monitor only a kV band)
and `Branch.LineMonEle` / `Bus.BusMonEle` (switch off one device).

### Verify it worked

Load the file back into the open case and assert — never trust the write:

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("EnterMode(EDIT);")
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("Delete(Contingency);")     # LoadAux MERGES; delete to replace
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand(f'LoadAux("{absolute_path}", NO);')
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("EnterMode(RUN);")
```

Assert **three** things, because each failure looks like success:

1. the loaded `CTGLabel` set equals what you wrote — a parse failure loads a prefix;
2. the `ContingencyElement` **count** equals what you wrote — a contingency with no element
   loads fine and outages nothing, which reads as "the grid survives everything";
3. every area's `BGReportLimits` came back as intended.

### Gotchas beyond the five in the Abstract

- **A device that gets no contingency is normal, not a bug.** Autoinsert requires both ends
  ≥ 69 kV **and** `LineStatus == 'Closed'`, and `Handle3WXF=INSERT3WXF` collapses a
  3-winding transformer's three branch rows into **one** contingency — so three device rows
  legitimately map to one label. Report the bucket with a per-device reason; do not abort.
- **The dominant unmatched cause on a real planning model is the 3-winding transformer's
  star bus, and it presents as a kV failure, not as a 3WXF one.** A 3W transformer is
  modelled as three branches meeting at a **fictitious star/tertiary bus carried at ~1 kV
  nominal**, so the winding branches touching it fail the 69 kV floor and autoinsert never
  builds a branch contingency for them. (measured 2026-08-17, on regional planning cases: 111
  of 273 new branches.) Do not read that bucket as missing coverage — the transformer
  itself is covered by the single collapsed `T_…` contingency; what is absent is a separate
  outage of an internal winding, which is not a real N-1 event.
- **`GetFieldList` on an object name that does not exist can fault `pwrworld.exe`** with an
  access violation rather than returning an error. Do not fuzz object names.
- Autoinsert labels are **not** unique-safe to parse: `L_`/`T_`/`G_` + truncated substation
  names. Treat them as opaque keys.
