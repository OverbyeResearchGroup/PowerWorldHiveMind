# Reference: PowerWorld SCRIPT actions — working subset

## Abstract

A task-organized index of the PowerWorld SCRIPT actions this kit's workflows actually
use, plus their close neighbours — 198 of the ~370 that Simulator defines. Look
here to find *which* command does a job; look in Simulator's own *Auxiliary File Format*
manual for argument lists and exact syntax, which this page deliberately does not
reproduce. Every command runs the same way: `pw.esa.RunScriptCommand("ActionName(args)")`,
or inside a `SCRIPT { }` block in an `.aux` file. Start at [esapp-overview](../methods/esapp-overview.md) for the
Python side.

## Connections

- **Up:** [Home](../index.md)
- **Across:** [esapp](../concepts/esapp.md) · [powerworld-simauto](../concepts/powerworld-simauto.md) · [esapp-schema-reference](esapp-schema-reference.md)
- **Deeper:** [esapp-package-backend](esapp-package-backend.md)

## Content

> **Descriptions here are written for this kit, not copied from PowerWorld's
> documentation.** They say what a command is *for* in the context of these workflows.
> For argument order, optional parameters, and filter syntax, consult Simulator's
> *Auxiliary File Format* manual — it ships with the program under Help, and it is the
> authority. Where this page and the manual disagree, the manual is right.

### How a script action is invoked

```python
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT)')
pw.esa.RunScriptCommand('SaveCase("C:\\out\\case.pwb", PWB, YES)')
```

Two rules that cause most first-attempt failures, both documented at
[save-powerworld-case](../methods/save-powerworld-case.md) and [new-device-contingency-aux](../methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md):

- File paths must be **absolute**. A relative path resolves against Simulator's current
  working directory, which is not your script's.
- `LoadAux` **merges** into the open case rather than replacing it. Loading the same aux
  twice duplicates its objects.

### Opening, saving, and case lifecycle

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `OpenCase` | Open a `.pwb` from disk, replacing whatever is loaded |
| `NewCase` | Start from an empty case |
| `AppendCase` | Merge a second case into the open one |
| `SaveCase` | Write the case to disk. **Use this, not the COM `SaveCase`** — see [save-powerworld-case](../methods/save-powerworld-case.md) |
| `EnterMode` | Switch between `RUN` and `EDIT`. Many data writes are rejected outside `EDIT` |
| `Scale` | Scale load, generation, or injection by a factor or to a target total |
| `Equivalence` | Reduce the case to an equivalent of the retained subsystem |
| `DeleteExternalSystem` | Drop everything outside the retained area/zone selection |
| `SaveExternalSystem` | Write the external subsystem out separately |
| `LoadEMS` | Read an EMS-format snapshot |
| `RenumberBuses` | Renumber buses en masse — changes key fields, so re-read any DataFrame you held |
| `RenumberAreas`, `RenumberZones`, `RenumberSubs` | Same, for those container types |
| `RenumberCase` | Apply a renumbering scheme across the whole case |
| `Renumber3WXFormerStarBuses` | Renumber the hidden star buses inside three-winding transformers |
| `CaseDescriptionSet`, `CaseDescriptionClear` | Set or clear the case's description text |

### Reading and writing data

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `SetData` | Write field values on existing objects. **Requires the entire key-field row** or it errors — see [powerworld-limitset-setdata](../methods/powerworld-limitset-setdata.md) |
| `CreateData` | Create new objects (buses, branches, loads, generators) — see [adding-devices-esapp](../methods/adding-devices-esapp.md) |
| `SetElseCreateData` | Set one object's fields if it exists, else create it from defaults. The aux language's only exists-check — see [aux-only-powerworld](../concepts/aux-only-powerworld.md). Added September 2026; older Simulator 24 builds will not have it |
| `Delete` | Delete objects of a type matching a filter |
| `DeleteDevice` | Delete one specific device |
| `DeleteIncludingContents` | Delete a container and everything inside it |
| `LoadAux` | Read an `.aux` file into the case. Absolute path; **merges** |
| `LoadAuxDirectory` | Load every aux in a directory |
| `LoadCSV`, `LoadData`, `ImportData` | Bulk-import records from CSV or another data source |
| `LoadScript` | Run a named `SCRIPT` block from an aux file |
| `SaveData` | Export a table of objects and chosen fields to file |
| `SaveDataWithExtra` | Same, with additional computed columns |
| `SaveDataUsingBuiltInAUXFormat` | Export as aux using Simulator's own field layout |
| `SaveDataUsingExportFormat` | Export using a named custom format |
| `SaveDataEPC` | Export in EPC format |
| `SaveObjectFields` | Write out which fields exist for an object type |
| `SelectAll`, `UnSelectAll` | Set or clear the `Selected` flag, which many other actions filter on |
| `SendtoExcel` | Push a table to Excel. Note the lowercase `t` — the obvious spelling fails |
| `WriteLimitMonitoringSettings` | Dump the current limit-monitoring configuration |

### Solving power flow

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `SolvePowerFlow` | Solve. Takes the method: `RECTNEWT`, `POLARNEWT`, `GAUSSSEIDEL`, `FASTDEC`, `DC` |
| `ResetToFlatStart` | Reset voltages to 1.0 pu / 0 degrees before a hard solve |
| `EstimateVoltages` | Seed a starting voltage profile when flat start will not converge |
| `ZeroOutMismatches` | Force mismatches to zero — diagnostic, not a fix |
| `UpdateIslandsAndBusStatus` | Recompute island membership and energization after topology edits |
| `VoltageConditioning`, `ConditionVoltagePockets` | Repair local voltage anomalies that block convergence |
| `InitializeGenMvarLimits` | Reset generator reactive limits to their defined values |
| `GenForceLDC_RCC` | Force line-drop / reactive-current compensation behaviour |
| `SaveJacobian` | Write the Jacobian matrix to file |
| `SaveYbusInMatlabFormat` | Write Ybus in MATLAB format |
| `StoreState`, `RestoreState`, `DeleteState` | Snapshot and roll back a solved state. Cheaper than reloading the case between scenarios |
| `ClearPowerFlowSolutionAidValues` | Clear stored solution aids |

**A DC solve always reports zero mismatch.** It cannot tell you that your generation
schedule is short — the slack bus absorbs it silently. Check the schedule against total
load directly. See [applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case](../methods/applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case.md).

### Contingency analysis

| Action | What it is for |
|---|---|
| `CTGSolveAll` | Solve every active contingency. The workhorse |

| `CTGApply` | Apply a contingency's actions to the case without solving |
| `CTGAutoInsert` | Generate a contingency set automatically from the case topology |
| `CTGPrimaryAutoInsert` | Auto-insert primary contingencies only |
| `CTGRestoreReference` | Return the case to its pre-contingency reference state |
| `CTGSetAsReference` | Mark the current state as the reference base |
| `CTGClearAllResults` | Clear stored results. **Do this first** — results persist stale inside the `.pwb`, see [reading-violationctg](../methods/reading-violationctg.md) |
| `CTGProduceReport` | Write a formatted violation report |
| `CTGSaveViolationMatrices` | Export the violation matrices |
| `CTGWriteResultsAndOptions` | Write results plus the option set that produced them |

| `CTGDeleteWithIdenticalActions`, `CTGSkipWithIdenticalActions` | Remove or skip duplicates by action set |
| `CTGConvertAllToDeviceCTG`, `CTGConvertToPrimaryCTG` | Convert between contingency representations |
| `CTGCreateStuckBreakerCTGs`, `CTGCreateExpandedBreakerCTGs` | Build breaker-failure contingencies |
| `CTGCreateContingentInterfaces` | Create interfaces defined by contingency outcomes |
| `CTGRelinkUnlinkedElements` | Re-bind contingency elements whose keys stopped resolving |
| `CTGJoinActiveCTGs` | Combine active contingencies into one |
| `CTGComboSolveAll`, `CTGComboDeleteAllResults` | Solve or clear combination contingencies |
| `CTGCalculateOTDF` | Outage transfer distribution factors |
| `CTGCompareTwoListsofContingencyResults` | Diff two result sets |
| `CTGProcessRemedialActionsAndDependencies` | Evaluate remedial action schemes |
| `CTGVerifyIteratedLinearActions` | Validate iterated linear contingency actions |
| `CTGReadFilePTI`, `CTGReadFilePSLF`, `CTGWriteFilePTI` | Exchange contingency sets with PSS/E and PSLF |
| `CTGWriteAllOptions` | Dump every contingency analysis option |
| `DoCTGAction` | Execute a single contingency action directly |

Building a contingency set for a chosen device list is its own procedure with several
silent failure modes (`ElementType=GEN` is ignored; the action string must be quoted;
labels get whitespace-trimmed on load) — see [new-device-contingency-aux](../methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md).

| `TimeStepLoadTSB`, `TimeStepLoadB3D` | Load time-series data in TSB or B3D format |
| `TimeStepDoRun` | Run the full time-step simulation |
| `TimeStepDoSinglePoint` | Solve one time point only — use this to debug setup before a long run |

`PWW` (PowerWorld Weather data) and `PFW` (the renewable output model) are different

### What this page leaves out

Simulator defines roughly 370 SCRIPT actions. Omitted here as outside this kit's scope:
oneline and user-interface actions, fault analysis, ATC, integrated topology processing,
regions, scheduled actions, distributed computing, the trainer, and customer-specific
actions. If you need one of those, the *Auxiliary File Format* manual lists them by the
same category names used above.
