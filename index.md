## Demos — worked examples with real output

Complete runs on a real 37-bus case, including what goes wrong and how it was fixed.

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [aux-file-cookbook](demos/aux-file-cookbook.md) | Claude in one window, Simulator in the other. Four recipes in order: turn the channel on, prove it with a four-line script, inventory a case, then take a bus out and measure it. Start here if you are working through files rather than Python. |
| [adding-a-device](demos/adding-a-device.md) | Three attempts that reported success and created nothing, then the fix. `CreateData` accepts a malformed call and builds nothing. If you read one demo, read this one. |
| [comparing-planning-cases](demos/comparing-planning-cases.md) | Diff a 2016 and a 2024 case to find what the plan builds — 691 new branches, 199 new generators — then solve a contingency set for only the new devices. Includes the scoping trap that makes the naive answer 87% wrong. |
| [contingency-and-aux](demos/contingency-and-aux.md) | Run N-1 from nothing, then write a filter and contingency `.aux` from the result and load it back. 89 auto-inserted contingencies, 12 violations, 5 targeted ones merged. |
| [power-flow-and-sensitivities](demos/power-flow-and-sensitivities.md) | AC and DC solves plus LODF and PTDF, including the `1e8` sentinel that makes LODF output look insane and a PTDF failure whose obvious fix fails the same way. |
| [start-here](demos/start-here.md) | The one-line prompts to open with, and worked runs on a 37-bus case with every failure left in on purpose. |
| [timestep-and-pfw](demos/timestep-and-pfw.md) | Turn a weather file into hourly wind and solar output, starting with the check that decides whether the case can do it at all: do its renewable units carry PFW model strings? Here, 9 of 45 did. |
| [violation-remediation](demos/violation-remediation.md) | The full study: find 12 N-1 violations, work out why they happen, test five reinforcements, and rank them by measured effect. Two of the five made the system worse. |

## Methods — how to do a thing

Step-by-step procedures. Read the one that matches your task.

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [adding-devices-esapp](methods/adding-devices-esapp.md) | Create buses, branches and loads in an open case, then solve a DC OPF and screen N-1. The write-side counterpart to esapp-overview. |
| [aux-file-mode](methods/aux-file-mode.md) | PowerWorld and LLM interaction through files: the agent writes `.aux`, you drop it into a watched folder, results come back as CSVs. The GUI setup handshake an agent cannot perform itself, the rules (never `OpenCase`, never `LogClear`, always read back), and a working template to copy. |
| [applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case](methods/applying-a-dispatch-to-a-case.md) | Turn a MW-per-generator dispatch into a runnable scenario case. The DC solve fakes a balance rather than telling you the fleet is short. |
| [converting-lines-to-transformers](methods/converting-lines-to-transformers.md) | Reclassify branches as transformers when a case models every branch as a line. `BranchDeviceType` is read-only; the real switch is `LineXFMR = "YES"` plus the nominal kV fields. |
| [esapp-overview](methods/esapp-overview.md) | The starting page: open a case, read and write data, solve power flow, and use `snapshot()` to experiment without damaging anything. |
| [handling-errors](methods/handling-errors.md) | What to do when something fails, sorted into fix it yourself, fix it and mention it, and stop and ask. |
| [how-to-analyze-results](methods/how-to-analyze-results.md) | Read the solar and wind CSVs a timestep run produces: the two-file naming, the 8-row metadata header, and the UTC timestamp conversion. |
| [new-device-contingency-aux](methods/new-device-contingency-aux.md) | Turn a list of devices into a contingency set plus an area-restricted violation filter, shipped as one `.aux` that loads without saving the case. |
| [powerworld-limitset-setdata](methods/powerworld-limitset-setdata.md) | Change PowerWorld's limit-monitoring thresholds. `SetData` on `LimitSet` fails with a missing-key-field error unless you supply the entire field row. |
| [preflight-powerworld](methods/preflight-powerworld.md) | Five checks in five seconds: can this machine drive PowerWorld from Python at all? Run it before writing any analysis code. |
| [ranking-new-devices-by-severity](methods/ranking-new-devices-by-severity.md) | Solve a new-device contingency set and answer which new device is worst. Produces one `devices.csv`, ranked worst first. |
| [reading-violationctg](methods/reading-violationctg.md) | Get which contingency caused which violation, keyed by `CTGLabel`, by reading `ViolationCTG` after `CTGSolveAll()`. |
| [reducing-a-contingency-set](methods/reducing-a-contingency-set.md) | `CTGSkip` and `Delete` do different jobs and get confused for each other. `CTGSkip` partitions a set without shrinking it. |
| [save-powerworld-case](methods/save-powerworld-case.md) | Write an open case back to disk. The COM `SaveCase` returns success and writes no file, so use the script form and check the file exists. |
| [teamoverbyeweather-client](methods/teamoverbyeweather-client.md) | Download a weather dataset, crop it to a region and a time window, and get `.pww` files ready for PowerWorld. Pure Python — no PowerWorld licence needed. |
| [timestep-simulation-setup](methods/timestep-simulation-setup.md) | Drive TimeStep to turn `.pww` files into hourly generation CSVs, including the per-generator prerequisites a case must satisfy first. |
| [visualize-renewable-output](methods/visualize-renewable-output.md) | Plot the timestep CSVs: fleet totals over time, per-ISO and per-state breakdowns, capacity-factor curves, and peak and trough hours. |

## Concepts — what a thing is

Background. Read when a method references something you do not recognise.

| Page | What it covers |
|---|---|
| [aux-only-powerworld](concepts/aux-only-powerworld.md) | A `.aux` file is a complete program — open a case, edit it, solve it, export CSVs, write the log and exit, with no Python and no SimAuto call at all. Field names must come from esapp's schema or PowerWorld's own field export, never from the *Auxiliary File Format* manual, which has no per-object field catalog. |
| [case-impedance-completeness](concepts/case-impedance-completeness.md) | A case can solve DC power flow for years while carrying no resistance and no line charging at all. DC reads only `X`, so nothing ever complains. |
| [case-to-case-device-transplant](concepts/case-to-case-device-transplant.md) | Copy a set of devices from one case into another without rebuilding the chain that produced them, by carving a filtered AUX out of the source case. |
| [copper-plate](concepts/copper-plate.md) | Strip every branch, load and shunt and leave a single slack bus, so generators dispatch to total system load with no transmission constraints. |
| [esapp-environment](concepts/esapp-environment.md) | What `esapp` is, what it needs to run, and how the `PowerWorld` entry point, the bracket interface and the `SAW` wrapper fit together. |
| [esapp-script-command-wrappers](concepts/esapp-script-command-wrappers.md) | Why you call `pw.esa.TimeStepDoRun()` rather than `RunScriptCommand("TimeStepDoRun;")`, and the roughly 41 actions where no wrapper exists. |
| [esapp](concepts/esapp.md) | The full API map for `esapp`: top-level imports, architecture, and what the package can actually do. |
| [gic](concepts/gic.md) | Geomagnetically induced currents: what they do to transformers during a geomagnetic disturbance, and what PowerWorld models. |
| [glossary](concepts/glossary.md) | Every acronym and piece of jargon this kit uses, defined once. Read the confused-pairs section even if you skip the rest — PWW versus PFW has cost people whole afternoons. |
| [lodf](concepts/lodf.md) | Every branch's post-outage flow for every single-branch outage, from one matrix factorization. Measured live it is not an approximation of DC contingency analysis; it is the same answer. |
| [opf-preconditions](concepts/opf-preconditions.md) | LP OPF needs three independent preconditions at once — an area under `BGAGC = "OPF"`, AGC-able generators, and a real cost model — and misses a fatal error rather than a degraded solve. Synthetic cases routinely ship with all three off. |
| [parallel-contingency-solve](concepts/parallel-contingency-solve.md) | PowerWorld's own distributed `CTGSolveAll` never spawns workers here and silently degrades to serial. Split the contingency set across N processes instead. |
| [per-unit-basis-discipline](concepts/per-unit-basis-discipline.md) | A per-unit value is meaningless without the base it was normalized against, and it looks like a plain scalar, so it gets copied between sources and summed. |
| [powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data](concepts/powerworld-inertia-and-cost-data.md) | Four case-data facts to know before touching generator inertia or cost, starting with `Gen.TSH` being H on a 100 MVA system base rather than the unit's own. |
| [powerworld-script-transfer](concepts/powerworld-script-transfer.md) | Simulator 25 beta watches a directory and executes any `.aux` dropped in it, writing the log back to a text file — a channel into PowerWorld that needs no COM, no SimAuto and no SimAuto licence. Undocumented in the manual. |
| [powerworld-simauto](concepts/powerworld-simauto.md) | The Windows COM server every PowerWorld Python script ultimately talks to, its SAW mixin architecture, and the verified raw COM calls. |
| [pww-data](concepts/pww-data.md) | The PWW binary weather format: gridded variables packed as uint8 per timestep and grid point, with 255 as the NaN sentinel. |
| [timestep-simulation](concepts/timestep-simulation.md) | What a timestep simulation is here: hourly renewable output computed quasi-statically from weather data. It is not a transient-stability study. |
| [timestep-workflow](concepts/timestep-workflow.md) | The whole chain from a `.pww` file to per-generator hourly CSVs, in the order PowerWorld requires it. |
| [version-requirements](concepts/version-requirements.md) | Which Simulator version you need and what this kit was verified against: build 24.2026.7.22, with 13 of 14 feature areas confirmed working. |
