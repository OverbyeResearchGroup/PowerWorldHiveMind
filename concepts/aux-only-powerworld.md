# Driving PowerWorld with aux files alone

## Abstract

A PowerWorld `.aux` file is a complete program, not a fragment: one loaded file can open a
case, edit it, solve it, export results to CSV, write the message log to a text file and
exit, with **no Python and no SimAuto call of your own**. Live-verified 2026-09-11 on a
regional synthetic planning model. This page records what the aux language can do
unaided, the capabilities it structurally lacks (no return values, almost no control flow,
no assertions) and the read-back discipline that substitutes for them, the two conditional
constructs it *does* have — the solve-failure `STOP` slots and, since the September 2026
patch, `SetElseCreateData`'s exists-check — the syntax traps
measured the same day, and — most importantly — **the field-name provenance rule**: the
*Auxiliary File Format* manual is a syntax manual with no per-object field catalog, so
field names must come from esapp's generated schema or PowerWorld's own field export,
never from the manual and never from memory. Read before writing any `.aux` by hand.

### It works, and the whole loop closes

Verified 2026-09-11, ~9k-bus synthetic planning model, Simulator 24 build 577. A single
`.aux` loaded through the GUI performed, unattended, in file order:

```
OpenCase -> EnterMode(RUN) -> SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT) -> SaveData x2 -> LogSave
```

The log recorded `Simulation: Successful Power Flow Solution` and both CSVs landed on
disk. Nothing in the chain went through `pw.esa`, `RunScriptCommand`, `LoadAux` or
`ProcessAuxFile` from the caller's side — the file was simply opened.

The self-contained shape is:

```
SCRIPT
{
  LogClear;  LogAdd("start");  LogAddDateTime;
  OpenCase("<absolute path>.pwb");
  EnterMode(RUN);
  SolvePowerFlow(RECTNEWT);
  SaveData("<absolute path>.csv", CSV, Branch, [<fields>], [], "", [], NO, NO);
  LogSave("<absolute path>.txt", NO);
  ExitProgram;                     // omit to leave the GUI open
}
```

`LogSave` is the cheapest and only general feedback channel — everything PowerWorld says
during the run, including warnings you would otherwise never see, lands in that text file.

**Unnamed `SCRIPT { }` blocks auto-execute on load.** The manual never says so in a
positive sentence, but `StopAuxFile` is documented as suppressing every later SCRIPT and
DATA block in the file (which presupposes they would otherwise run), and `LoadScript` is
described as executing only the section it names — a restriction stated against normal
open-the-file behaviour. Naming a block makes it
*additionally* addressable via `LoadScript`; it does not gate it. Several `SCRIPT` blocks
interleaved with `DATA` blocks in one file is the manual's own canonical layout.

### The one branch aux does have: conditional-response slots

Several analysis actions take a pair of optional filename slots that fire on success and
on failure, and either slot accepts the literal `STOP`, which halts **all** aux execution:

```
SolvePrimalLP("", STOP);        // succeed: continue.  fail: halt the file.
```

The manual describes all four parameters as optional, and says they specify what should
happen conditionally on whether a solution was found. `InitializePrimalLP`,
`SolveSinglePrimalLPOuterLoop` and `SolveFullSCOPF` carry the same slots.

**Use them on every solve whose failure would invalidate what follows.** The bare form has
no failure handler, so a solve that does not converge lets every later stage run against
an unsolved case and write plausible-looking numbers to correctly-named files — the exact
silent failure this page's read-back rule exists to catch, arriving through the one door a
read-back does not cover.

### What the aux language cannot do, and what to do instead

Beyond those slots and `SetElseCreateData` below: no return values, no general branching,
no arithmetic over a table, no assertions. Consequently:

- **A failed edit is indistinguishable from a successful one at runtime.** The same family
  as [case-to-case-device-transplant](case-to-case-device-transplant.md)'s `ProcessAuxFile` trap — reports success, changes
  nothing.
- **Substitute a read-back CSV for every assertion.** After a write, `SaveData` the fields
  you just wrote, *before* any solve, to a file named for the check. Then read it. A run
  whose edit silently no-opped otherwise produces the unchanged case under new filenames,
  with plausible numbers throughout — the failure mode that ruins a study quietly.
- **Per-object arithmetic is impossible.** `SetData` writes one literal to every object
  matching a filter, so "set each unit to 80% of its own maximum" cannot be expressed.
  That is the honest boundary at which to go back to Python.

### The one exists-check: `SetElseCreateData`

Added in the **September 2026 patch of Simulator 24** — older builds do not have it, and
the aux will fail on a machine running one. PowerWorld's own justification names the gap
this page describes: *"Because AUX scripts provide no process control to determine if a
power flow case contains a particular object, this command provides a way to do that."*

```
SetElseCreateData(objecttype, [fieldlist], [SetValueList], [DefaultValueList]);
```

If the object exists it is updated; if it does not, it is created, and **Simulator switches
itself to EDIT mode to do so**. It affects exactly one object — there is no filter form, so
this is not a way to conditionally update a set.

The two value lists are where it goes wrong quietly:

- `[fieldlist]` must carry the key fields, and `[SetValueList]` must give them non-blank
  values. Same rule as everywhere else in this kit.
- **A blank entry (nothing between the commas) means "fall through to the default".** An
  empty pair of double-quotes `""` does *not* — it is a real value and suppresses the
  default. PowerWorld's own worked example turns on exactly this distinction: with
  `Status` written as `""` the command errors when the generator is absent, and with
  `Status` left blank it creates the generator using the default `"Closed"`.
- `[DefaultValueList]` is optional; omit it and Simulator's own defaults apply. Key fields
  in it are ignored.
- Creation still needs every **required** field to end up non-blank across the two lists.
  Most object types silently decline to create when a required field is blank.

```
SetElseCreateData(Bus, [Number, Name, AreaNumber, ZoneNumber, NomkV],
                       [1,,,3,], [1, "NewBus", 1, 3, 138]);
```

It does not lift the read-back rule. It tells you nothing about which branch it took, so
if the distinction matters, `SaveData` the object afterwards and look.

### The field-name provenance rule

**Simulator's own *Auxiliary File Format* manual documents script syntax and contains no
per-object field catalog.** Measured 2026-09-11: across ~10,300 lines, zero hits for any of
the Area or generator field names needed for an OPF setup. Re-confirmed 2026-09-12 against
the **September 1, 2026** edition — same result. **Check the `Last Updated` line on page 1
before trusting a claim sourced from it**: the manual gains actions between editions, and
the November 6, 2025 edition is missing four that exist by September 2026,
`SetElseCreateData` among them. The manual says so itself — it directs
you to *Window → Export Case Object Fields* in the GUI instead. It therefore cannot confirm
or refute a field name, ever.

So do not guess field names, and do not take them from prose pages in this vault either —
one such page in this wiki carried an Area field name that does not exist in the schema.

**Verify against esapp's generated schema first, then emit the aux.** This costs seconds,
needs no PowerWorld session, and is the correct workflow for authoring aux by hand:

```python
from esapp.components import Area
[f for f in Area.fields() if "AGC" in f.upper()]   # does the name exist?
Area.is_editable("BGAGC")                           # can it be written?
Area.is_edit_mode_only("BGAGC")                     # does it need EnterMode(EDIT)?
Area.keys()                                         # what identifies the object?
```

`is_edit_mode_only` is the one that decides whether an `EnterMode(EDIT)` wrapper is
required or merely noise. `keys()` matters because a `SetData` with no filter needs the
full key row (see below). Within a script, `SaveObjectFields` gets the same metadata —
variable name, field, column header and description — straight from the running program.

### Syntax traps, all measured 2026-09-11 against the manual

| Trap | Correct form |
|---|---|
| `SetData`'s "all objects" token is the **bare keyword** `ALL`. `""` is not legal — the quotes make it parse as a filter *named* empty string | `SetData(Area, [Field], ["Value"], ALL);` |
| With **no** filter, `SetData` requires the object's full key row in the field list | see `Type.keys()` |
| `SaveObjectFields` takes **three required** arguments; the field list is not optional | `SaveObjectFields("f.csv", Area, [FieldA, FieldB]);` |
| `SaveData`'s `Transpose` and `Append` are **scalars**, not lists — a `[]` there is wrong even when it appears to work | `..., filter, [SortFieldList], NO, NO);` |
| `SaveData`'s filter *may* be blank (unlike `SetData`'s) — blank means all objects | `..., [], "", [], NO, NO);` |
| The `ALL` keyword is documented as usable "instead of a list of fields" on the Save commands, but the manual gives **no worked example anywhere** — bare `ALL` vs `[ALL]` is undocumented | use an explicit field list |
| Every file path must be **absolute**; a relative path resolves against `pwrworld.exe`'s working directory, not yours | — |
| **Smart quotes silently break a script.** Straight quotes only | never paste from Word or a PDF |
| Solver token is `POLARNEWTON`, not the commonly written `POLARNEWT` | `RECTNEWT`, `POLARNEWTON`, `GAUSSSEIDEL`, `FASTDEC`, `ROBUST`, `DC` |
| `EnterMode(EDIT)` is required only to **create** topology objects. Modifying an existing one is not documented as needing it | keep the wrapper anyway; it costs nothing and the manual never positively blesses modify-in-RUN |

`DATA (Object, [fields]) { rows }` is the legacy header form and is correct; omitting the
file-type specifier means space-delimited rows. `BusNum:1` is the to-bus (`variablename:location`,
where `:0` may be omitted). Quoting string values is optional but advisable.

### When to use this, and when not to

Aux-only is right when the logic is declarative and the value is auditability: the whole
study is one reviewable text file, diffable and version-controllable, with no Python
environment to reproduce. It is wrong the moment you need to branch on a result, compute
per-object values, or assert anything beyond "read it back and look".

The middle path costs five lines and keeps both: author the whole study as `.aux` text and
use Python purely as the launcher via `exec_aux`, which buys back the read-back assertion
without moving any logic into Python. stochastic model backend already runs this way.
