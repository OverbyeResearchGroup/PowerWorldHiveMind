# Case-to-case device transplant

## Abstract

How to copy a set of devices from one PowerWorld case into another without rebuilding the chain
that produced them — useful whenever a feature was developed on one scenario and the others are
stranded behind unscripted stages. Carve a **filtered AUX out of the source case's own
`SaveCase(AUX)` dump** so the field lists are PowerWorld's rather than hand-written, and load it
with `LoadAux(create_if_not_found=True)`. To *move* a device between buses, carve its record out
of the **target** case and re-point the bus number, so the whole schema transfers by construction.
Proven 2026-09-01 on four Synth9k scenarios: 869 buses, 1,207 shunts, 1,019 branches, 724 gen
moves, 147 load moves, criterion-10 clean on all four.

## Connections

- Used in a scenario-envelope study, to answer an accepted migration risk.
- Complements reading a case diff — that is about *reading* a diff across two model
  vintages, this one is about *applying* one.
- Depends on the same key-field constraint as circuit-ID renaming: some fields can only be changed
  through an AUX text round-trip, never by a write.
- 💡 **Could transfer to:** any study where one scenario got a
  feature and the rest need it, or where a chain is unreproducible and only the *result* survives.

## Content

### The method

1. `SaveCase(AUX)` the **source** case. Its per-object blocks (`Bus (…) { … }`) carry PowerWorld's
   own complete field lists — never hand-write one, and never assume a field name.
2. Keep only the records you want, by key. Watch for **duplicate blocks**: a full dump writes
   `Bus`, `Gen`, `Load` and `Branch` more than once (the extras carry cost / OPF fields). Filter
   every occurrence, not the first.
3. Write them back out ordered **Bus → Shunt → Branch → Transformer** so references resolve.
4. Load into the **target** with `LoadAux(path, create_if_not_found=True)`.

### The trap that eats an hour

**`ProcessAuxFile` on a data aux creates nothing and reports success.** No error, no warning, and
the device counts are simply unchanged. `LoadAux(..., create_if_not_found=True)` is the working
call; the create flag is the entire difference. Assert on device counts after the load, never on
the absence of an exception — a discipline guards that report evidence they did not gather
argues for generally.

### Moving a device between buses

There is no move operation. Delete-and-recreate risks dropping fields silently — the
`LoadGrounded` bug hit all 147 loads in the original migration and was invisible to a diff over
the write set, because a dropped field is by definition absent from it.

**Carve the record out of the TARGET case's own aux and re-point only the leading bus-number
token, then delete the original.** The whole schema then transfers by construction: there is no
field list to get wrong, and no value from the source case can leak in. This is what makes the
technique safe across scenarios — a moved generator keeps *its own* scenario's dispatch, not the
donor's.

### Always undo the text rounding

The aux writes R/X/C to 6 decimals and MW / limits to 3. Snapshot exact values before the
round-trip and write them back afterwards, confirming on read-back. Skipping this left 147 moved
loads 7.3e-3 MW light — small enough to pass a loose tolerance and wrong enough to poison a
conservation check later.

### esapp notes

- esapp has **no `change_and_confirm_params_multiple_element`** (the older `esa` package does).
  Write with `ChangeParametersMultipleElement`, then read back and compare yourself.
- `GetParametersMultipleElement` returns **`None`**, not an empty frame, for an object type with
  zero instances — a case with no shunts will crash a naive `len()`.
- See [esapp](esapp.md) and the `SaveCase` script-command trap: `pw.save()` writes nothing silently.

### When the numbering cooperates, check for it first

The Synth9k transplant needed **no renumbering at all**, because the target topped out at bus 8528
and every new bus in the source was 8529–9397. That is worth two minutes of checking before
designing a remap: disjoint ranges turn a hard problem into a copy.
